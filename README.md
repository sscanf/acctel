I developed this project in the early 2000s.

It is a firmware for a remote control built by the company, which is controlled via telephone. 
It is possible to install several remote controls on the same telephone line and activate / deactivate a total of 8 relays per device.

It is written in C (CCS compiler) for the PIC 16f84A microcontroller
